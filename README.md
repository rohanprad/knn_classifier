# Implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors Classifier

Here, we use Python to implement a basic K Nearest Neighbors Classifier algorithm using Euclidean distance between the vectors as the distance measure. Then we compare its performance with the scikit-learn version of the KNN Classifier on the _iris_ data set.
